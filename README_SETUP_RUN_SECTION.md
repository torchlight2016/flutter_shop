## Getting Started: Setup and Run

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Flutter SDK**: You need to have the Flutter SDK installed on your system. If you haven't already, please follow the official installation guide: [Flutter SDK Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   **IDE/Editor**: An IDE like Android Studio (with Flutter plugin) or Visual Studio Code (with Flutter extension) is recommended.
*   **Emulator/Device**: Ensure you have an Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or a physical device connected and configured for development.

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project repository using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this repository.)*

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder:
    ```bash
    cd <project_folder_name>
    ```
    *(Replace `<project_folder_name>` with the name of the project directory.)*

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the following command to fetch all the necessary Flutter packages and dependencies defined in `pubspec.yaml`:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables:**
    This project uses `flutter_dotenv` to manage environment-specific configurations (like API keys, base URLs, etc.).
    *   Look for a file named `.env.example` in the root of the project.
    *   If it exists, create a copy of this file and name it `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Open the `.env` file and fill in any required values (e.g., API keys, database URLs).
    *   If `.env.example` does not exist, you may need to create a `.env` file manually. Consult with the project maintainers or look for documentation on required environment variables.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set up (if applicable), you can run the application on a connected device or emulator:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    *   If you have multiple devices/emulators connected, `flutter run` will prompt you to choose one.
    *   To run on a specific device, you can use `flutter run -d <device_id>`. You can get a list of available device IDs by running `flutter devices`.

You should now see the application running on your selected device/emulator. Happy coding!
